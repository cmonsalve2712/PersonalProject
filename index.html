<h1>Ways to Live a Full Life</h1>


 

<section class=main>
<p>
    
    Life’s true gift lies in your freedom to design it beautifully. With each rise of the sun, you get to chase the opportunity to fill your days with meaning to live your life the way you choose.

<p>
I’m not the type of woman that has a plan for everything in her lfe. In fact, the only plan I have is to do what I feel like doing in the moment. I don’t allow my mind to tell me stories about what I should have done. I like to live in the moment, listen to my energy around me, and take a break from everything when I need to. However, the most important part about living a full life, is to love yourself, about accepting and embracing your differences, treating yourself kindly and being happy and proud of who you are.
</p>
<p>Are you still trying to figure out how to live life to the fullest? If so, you’re far from alone. the sad thing is that most people go through life having never really experienced what life has to offer. What you need to understand is that everything holding you to a life you don’t want to live is a prison created by your own mind. That doesn’t mean you can just wish yourself into a new life, but it does mean that you can actively work towards living life to the fullest. It means that I don’t repress my emotions because I’m scared of the pain. It means that I let go of the concern of being liked by others and focus more on me liking myself. It means that I give my mind space to see people differently, to see myself differently, and to give us all the benefit of the doubt. It means that I’m willing to say yes when I want to say no because I know that the yes will serve me. It means that I’m willing to say no when I feel obligated to say yes because I know that boundaries mean everything when it comes to living a healthy life. It means that I’m willing to put in hard work when I need to and to walk away when I need to, too. It means that my life may not be easy, but it’s worth it.

     What Self-love Means to Me
    </h2>

<p>
Self-love to me is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth. When you learn to love yourself, life will improve dramatically. Oh, you won’t be perfect or flawless, but you will acquire “superpowers” that will make your weaknesses insignificant. Self-love empowers you with the mental toughness to accomplish your dreams and conquer any obstacles.

It might seem obvious, yet there are still so many people who don’t take 30 minutes of their day to treat their body right with exercise. Not every workout has to be a sweaty one, it doesn’t have to be long, or taxing on your body. But just move! Go for a walk before or after work, wake up 30 minutes early and do one of my HIIT workouts! Pull up a YouTube video of your favorite yoga class. Just move your body! Things start to fall into place with our minds, and nutrition when we give our bodies some love!

</p>
<p>
Did you also know that making healthy food choices is an act of self-love?. One of the best ways to practice self-love is by eating healthy and getting better sleep. Being mindful of your diet and sleep schedule will contribute to better habits and overall health. EVERY SINGLE PIECE of food creates your looks, creates your mood, creates your self-confidence or lack of, creates your passions and feelings, creates your fear or courage, creates your peace of mind or stress, the way your face looked this morning, your skin, your hair, your smile, your belly it all starts on your plate with the first bite. 
</p>

<p>
Self care is a vital part of maintaining good health and a vibrant life. It’s a way of living that incorporates behaviors that help you to be refreshed, replenish your personal motivation, and grow as a person.
